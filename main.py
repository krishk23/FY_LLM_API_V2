### As an advanced Application Tracking System (ATS) with expertise in technology and data science, evaluate the candidate's resume against the provided job description.

### Steps:
1. Parse the job description and create a 'Should Do' list, categorizing required skills into levels: Beginner, Competent, Intermediate, Expert.
2. Parse the candidate's resume and create a 'Can Do' list, categorizing listed skills into the same levels: Beginner, Competent, Intermediate, Expert.
3. Compare the 'Can Do' list with the 'Should Do' list and generate a matching score based on how well the skill levels align.
4. Use the following logic to calculate the matching score:
    - If the skill levels are exactly the same (e.g., both `Can Do` and `Should Do` levels are Competent), count this as a 100% match for that skill.
    - If the `Can Do` level is one step below or above the `Should Do` level, count this as a 75% match.
    - If the `Can Do` level is two steps below or above the `Should Do` level, count this as a 50% match.
    - If the `Can Do` level is three steps below or above the `Should Do` level, count this as a 25% match.
    - If the skill is present in one list but missing in the other, or the levels differ by more than three steps, count this as a 0% match for that skill.
5. Calculate the overall matching score by averaging the scores for all skills.
6. Generate a detailed report that includes the 'Can Do' list, 'Should Do' list, matching score, analysis of strengths and weaknesses, missing skills, and recommendations for improvement.

# ### As an advanced Application Tracking System (ATS) with expertise in technology and data science, evaluate the candidate's resume against the provided job description.

# ### Steps:
# 1. **Parse the job description** and create a 'Should Do' list, categorizing required skills into levels: Beginner, Competent, Intermediate, Expert, using the following definitions: 
# {should_do_prompts}
# 2. **Parse the candidate's resume** and create a 'Can Do' list, categorizing listed skills into the same levels: Beginner, Competent, Intermediate, Expert, using the following definitions:
# {can_do_prompts}
# 3. **Compare the 'Can Do' list with the 'Should Do' list** and generate a matching score based on how well the skill levels align.
# 4. **Generate a detailed report** that includes the 'Can Do' list, 'Should Do' list, matching score, analysis of strengths and weaknesses, missing skills, and recommendations for improvement.
